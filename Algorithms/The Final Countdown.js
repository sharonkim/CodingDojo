// This is based on "Flexible Countdown". The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; don't be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4), print the multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don't print) that one. Do this using a WHILE loop.

function printMultParam1(num){

    var param1 = x
    while(var param2 < param3){
        if(param1 != param4){
            console.log(param1);
            param2++;
            param1 /= param1;
        }
    return count;
}
