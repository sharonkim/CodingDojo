            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extrememly popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="definitions"><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifies. <mark>var x;</mark></li>
                <li class="definitions"><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured into it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <mark>var x = 10;</mark></li>
                <li class="definitions"><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <mark>true</mark> or <mark>false;</mark> null - <mark>null</mark> aka nothing; Number - <mark>42</mark> or <mark>3.14159;</mark> String - <mark>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</mark> Array - <mark>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</mark> and Object - <mark>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</mark></li>
                <li class="definitions"><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for defferent decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <mark>if</mark> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <mark>else if</mark> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <mark>else</mark> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li class="definitions"><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of tims. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
                <li class="definitions"><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function, this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea. We open up the instruction manual and get started. First, we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function over and over and over again.</li>
