                        <h5 id="subtitle">A structured set of data</h5>
                        <p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or a non-relational database. Relationships mean a set of our data is related to another section of our data. Meanwhile, in a non-relational database, there is not a common-related section of our data. Our databases are put into sections of data called "schemas". Inside each schema, each data set is organized into tables. The tables contain columns and rows to house a particular set of data.</p>

                    <div class="info-box"> <!--contains storage image and information-->
                        <h4>Storage</h4>
                        <img src="harddrive.jpg" alt="harddrive image">
                        <div class="">
                            <p>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on your harddrive, often times large companies will have floors upon floors of just database storage (think NSA-styled). Our computer stores information on the harddrive. We are able to create new information, read information, update information, and delete information.</p>

                        <p>Since there could potentially be a lot of information a database stores, one problem we might run into is finding the data we are looking for. Imagine we had a room full of books, and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well, you might start picking up each book, checking the title, and moving onto the next, until you've found it. That's very slow, as most libraries discovered. Instead, if we were to ID each item, we can find it quickly.</p>

                        <p>The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage bin that holds onto all saved data. Well, if only one user had access to that data, it's just like what we have built into our own computers, it wouldn't be useful to other users. However, the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin many users can interact with, creating, reading, updating, and deleting information that all users would see.</p>

                        <p>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the storing of infomration. As Big Data has erupted, so too have the size and amount of companies on the market. That being said, a lot of their software is free for most user, think of MySQL, which while being an incredible DB, is completely free of cost and is used by a large company called Facebook.</p>
